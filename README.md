## Algorand - Overview

### What is Algorand?

### What are the benefits and Unique Selling Points of Algorand?

### How is Algorand guaranteed to never fork?

The probability of a network fork occurring is a function of a parameter that Silvio set at the creation of Algorand. He decided to set it to have a 1 in 1 000 000 000 000 000 000 block risk (1/10^-18). Note that the the age of the Universe is estimated at around 13.772 billion years, which is roughly 4.3 x 10^17 seconds. Thus, the probability of a fork taking place is pretty much non-existent.

### Why should I create tokens on Algorand specifically?

Algorand has a number of advantages:

- Scalability: It can handle thousands of transactions per second.
- Cheap: Transaction fees are low, at 1000 microALGOs (0.001 ALGOs).
- Fast: Transaction finality at around ~4.5 seconds.
- Uniqueness: Guaranteed to not fork.

The last benefit is very important, as tokens - especially Non-Fungible Tokens - should only exist in one place, and with Algorand you can be confident whatever tokens you create will be the only ones in existence.

The first three benefits mean that an organization that wishes to mint thousands, tens of thousands, or even millions of tokens can do so _reliabily_. In fact, the Italian[ SIAE launched over 4 million NFTs](https://www.algorand.com/ecosystem/use-cases/siae) on Algorand representing the creative rights of 100000+ creators it represents. Algorand was able to

### Why should I care about tokens (FTs and NFTs)?

The first Internet can be described as the Internet of Information - it allows us to reliably share data representing text, audio, video and more in a decentralized web of computers that stretches all over the world. One of the innovations that blockchain technologies give us is that it allows the digital sharing, storing and transacting of value.

Algo, the native currency of Algorand, is the digital equivalent of "money". The fact that we could represent it digitally is a big achievement. But in this world, there are other things of value that you might own: property, vehicles, securities (e.g. stocks), commodities, membership reward points, intellectual property, etc - to name a few. Anything of value can be represented on the blockchain by minting a token of it.

One might ask themselves why you'd want to do that, why not use traditional web and database technologies? There are three main advantages of representing these things on a blockchain like Algorand:

1) Atomic Swaps

An atomic swap is a transaction where a set of coins or tokens are swaped for another set of coins or tokens in one single transaction such that one cannot be transferred without the other also being transferred.

Consider buying a car second hand. There are two transfers that take place: money and ownership. The buy transfers money to the seller, and in return the seller transfers the ownership. The fomrer might involve the use of a bank, and the latter might involve a governmental agency in charge of vehicle registration.

Instead of having to perform two transfers, with as sophisticated blockchain technology like Algorand, this can be done in a _single transaction_, involving only the relevant parties. The buraucracy that comes with relying on a governmental agency can be offloaded almost entirely to the blockchain, and the economic rents extracted by the bank disappears as well.

You might also consider the risk that the seller might take the money and disappear with it, without giving you the rights of the car, or even the car at all. The former happening would not be possible due to the nature of atomic swaps. The risk of the later remains, but at least, in the eyes of the post-Blockchain law the person would be committing grand theft auto.

2) Control

With tokens, there is a distinction between who owns it at any given point in time, and who created it. The person who created it can sell it while at the same time raiting certain rights. Algorand notably has a clawback function, meaning that if specified, any token could be brought back to the owner of the clawback address. E.g., if a user of am membership rewards program broke some kind of code of conduct.

Algorand also offers the freeze function. An asset being frozen means that it cannot be transferred anywhere, so the owner can own it but not send it to anyone else. Consider a music artist minting an NFT of a song they made, representing the rights to it. They sell it off to Record Label A, which starts to collect revenue on it, but the artist could choose to freeze it in the label's account. One day, Record Label A decides to sell it off to Record Label B. With smart contracts, a chain of logic could be set that measn the artist will unfreeze the asset for transfer, but only if they receive some kind of reward for it.

 This way, the artist is able to moneitze the song again and again everytime the rights are sold. For government, if they had minted the NFT representing the registration and ownership of car mentioned in the previous part, they could do the same and thus force citizens to pay a form of "tax" to allow this to happen.

## Miscelleanous

### Is Algorand in talks with Central Banks?

### What is the connection between Silvio and the SEC?

The current head of the SEC, Gary Gensler, was previously a professor at MIT teaching the course [MIT 15.S12 Blockchain and Money](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/). Silvio Micali was also at MIT at the same time and Gensler mentions him and Algorand on at least two occassions in the lecture series. Thus, it can be concluded that Gensler is aware of Algorand and its unique selling points.
